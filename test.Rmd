## R Markdown

**combining <del>*a few* </del> of them** 

#### Bullet Points
- How about lists?
- They work nicely too
	+ Sometimes
		+ we can even
			- indent
				* them

## Ordered Lists
1. They are
2. also 
3. easy to
4. pull off
	- have non-ordered lists
	- nested into the ordered ones
		1. Or vice-versa
		2. Isn't that great??

### Coating
