**combining <del>*a few* </del> of them**

#### Bullet Points

-   How about lists?
-   They work nicely too
    -   Sometimes
        -   we can even
            -   indent
                -   them

Ordered Lists
-------------

1.  They are
2.  also
3.  easy to
4.  pull off
    -   have non-ordered lists
    -   nested into the ordered ones
        1.  Or vice-versa
        2.  Isn't that great??

### Coating

This great statement is from :

> "It is a capital mistake to theorize before one has data. Insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories, instead of theories to suit facts."

### Including Figures
